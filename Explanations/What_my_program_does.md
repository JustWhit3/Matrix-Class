# Matrices Computations

## General Introduction
The purpose of this program is to perform a good part of the main useful mathematical operations between matrices. This program has been developed in order to train my C++ coding skills for the exam of "Elementi di programmazione per la fisica" of the Bachelor's degree.

## Operations

List of the executable operations within the program:

- Sum and difference between matrices: see [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:matrices/x9e81a4f98389efdf:adding-and-subtracting-matrices/a/adding-and-subtracting-matrices).

- Rows by columns matrices product: see [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:matrices/x9e81a4f98389efdf:multiplying-matrices-by-matrices/a/multiplying-matrices).
