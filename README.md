- [Explanations](https://github.com/JustWhit3/Matrix-Class/tree/master/Explanations): this folder contains all the documents related to the explanations of the program from a theoretical point of view. In this, you will not find explicit references to the code or to the technical aspects of the project, but only theoretical explanations. If someone is interested to see right away the complete explanation of the program and the final results, the link is [here](https://github.com/JustWhit3/Matrix-Class/blob/master/Explanations/What_my_program_does.md).

- [Reference Guides](https://github.com/JustWhit3/Matrix-Class/tree/master/Reference%20Guides): this folder contains all the reference guides related to the understanding of how work all the functions and classes defined in the project.

NOTE: for each folder there is a proper README.md file that explains in detail what are the documents inside it and what they do.
